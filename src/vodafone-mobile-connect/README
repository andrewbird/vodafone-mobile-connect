This software should work (in theory) with any device that follows the
relevants GSM and 3G specs. Nonetheless, every device is different and it may
not work in an untested device. Try it at your own risk. If you speak Python
and feel venturous you could get involved by supporting a new device / Distro
or even new OS.
