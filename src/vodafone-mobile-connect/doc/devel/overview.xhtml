<h1>Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux overview</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux is a 3G device manager
originally written in Python for the Linux OS <span class="footnote">although
there are some secret plans to port it to other OSes such as *BSD, Windows,
OS X, etc. Being Python multiplatform, you are only really constrained by
Twisted's
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/choosing-reactor.html">support</a>
of your chosen GUI toolkit.</span>.

Some of its features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pluggable architecture that can be extended by plugins</li>
<li>Make mobile data connections over the network</li>
<li>Send, receive and manage SMS from your computer</li>
<li>CRUD interface for contacts</li>
<li>Operator-agnostic (can be used by customers of other companies)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The big picture</h2>

<p>Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux architecture is
relatively simple, the code is divided in two big blocks: <b>Core</b> and
<b>GUI</b>. While Core provides all the low-level communication with the 3G
device, GUI is just the interface to the application.</p>

<h3>The big picture explained</h3>

<p>The above image shows the different stacks of components and how they
rely on each other. All the light-violet boxes are internal components,
while the black and white boxes are external components that this
software relies on. This diagram is oversimplified and only shows some
of the components, the actual UML diagram has more than 170 classes.</p>

<p>As we can see in the core layer, the
<a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> framework sits at the
heart of this application. Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux
sports an asynchronous core built upon the superb Twisted framework.</p>

<p>The <code class="API">vmc.common.hardware.HardwareRegistry</code> class
manages all the device discovery on Unix/Linux systems through
<a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org">DBus</a> and
<a href="http://hal.freedesktop.org">Hal</a>. <code>HardwareRegistry</code>
will emit <code>DeviceAdded</code> and <code>DeviceRemoved</code> signals
upon hotplugging events.</p>

<p>A device found through the HardwareRegistry will be attached to the
<code class="API" base="vmc.common.protocol">SIMCardConnection</code> class.
This class provides the necessary methods to interact with the 3G device,
like reading all the contacts in the SIM card or obtaining the IMSI
number. <code class="API" base="vmc.common.protocol">SIMCardConnection</code>
is wrapped by
<code class="API" base="vmc.common.protocol">SIMCardConnAdapter</code>.
SIMCardConnAdapter encapsulates error control and high-level operations
over the SIMCardConnection class.</p>

<p><code class="API" base="vmc.common.protocol">WVDialProtocol</code> is
used while connecting to the Internet. Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver
for Linux uses <a href="http://open.nit.ca/wvdial">wvdial</a> for the PPP
dialing. The WVDialProtocol class manages and monitors wvdial, it will
issue signals to the upper layers informing of any errors or exceptions
occurred.</p>
